The solution involves either removing the invalid selector or correcting it to target an existing element.  For example:

**Option 1: Remove the invalid selector:**

If the '.invalid-selector' class is no longer needed, simply remove the entire rule.

```css
/* Remove this entire rule */
.invalid-selector { color: blue; }
```

**Option 2: Correct the selector:**

If the intent was to style an existing element, correct the selector to match the element's class or ID.

```css
/* Correct the selector if needed */
.valid-selector { color: blue; }
```

Remember to thoroughly check your HTML structure and CSS selectors to identify and resolve inconsistencies.
